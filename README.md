**Dataset:**
The study leverages the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. The data is not provided in this repository and needs to be requested directly from ADNI.

**Requirements:**
Python 3.7.4 (and above)
Tensorflow 2.6.0
Further details on all packages used can be found int he notebook.

**Description:**
A multi-modal, multi-class, attention-based deep learning framework to detect Alzheimer's disease using genetic, clinical, and imaging data from ADNI.

**Preprocessing:**
Steps include: generating a list of patient IDs with their diagnosis, clinical data, imaging data and genetics data.


**Training and Evaluation:**
Uni-modal model baselines for clinical, imaging and genetics data as well as a multimodal architecture model were trained and evaluated
